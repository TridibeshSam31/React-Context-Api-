React Context API is a state-sharing mechanism.
It lets you share data globally across components without passing props down manually at every level.

But don’t think of it as a replacement for every state. It’s NOT a mini-Redux.
Use it only when multiple deeply nested components need the same data.

The Problem Context Solves

Without Context:
App -> Component A -> Component B -> Component C -> Component D

If only Component D needs “theme = dark”, you’d have to pass it through every useless layer in between.

This is prop drilling.

Context kills this problem by letting ANY component access the value directly.


✔️ How Context Actually Works (Conceptual Flow)

There are 3 steps, and if any of these is unclear, you don’t understand Context:

1️⃣ Create the Context (the shared container)
const ThemeContext = React.createContext();
This creates a "box" where your shared value lives.

2️⃣ Provide the Value (make it available globally)
You wrap a component tree with a Provider:
<ThemeContext.Provider value={{ theme: "dark" }}>
    <App />
</ThemeContext.Provider>
Everything inside <Provider> can read the value.

3️⃣ Consume the Value (use it in any component)
const { theme } = useContext(ThemeContext);
No props passing. No drilling.

which values should be passed in the providers ??
Because Context has ONE job:

👉 Make some values globally available to ANY component without props.

So what values do we want global for a theme system?

✔ The current theme → "light" / "dark"
✔ The function that changes the theme → toggleTheme()

If you don’t pass these two things, components can’t:

read the theme

change the theme

That’s why the value prop is REQUIRED.



Where Context Is Perfect

Use Context ONLY for data that is:

✔️ 1. Needed in many components
✔️ 2. Not frequently changing
✔️ 3. Not huge in size

Examples:

Auth user data (name, email, token)
Theme (light/dark)
Language preference
Global modals state
Cart count (not full cart items)



Where Context Is a BAD Idea (Important)

Don’t use Context for:

Rapidly changing data (typing, animations, frequent API polling)
Large lists (products, messages, posts)
Local state that only 1–2 components need

Why?

Because every state update inside Context re-renders ALL consumers.
That kills performance.



Creating Context
import { createContext } from "react";

export const AuthContext = createContext();


Creating a Provider Component
export function AuthProvider({ children }) {
  const [user, setUser] = useState(null);

  const login = (data) => setUser(data);
  const logout = () => setUser(null);

  return (
    <AuthContext.Provider value={{ user, login, logout }}>
      {children}
    </AuthContext.Provider>
  );
}

Using It
import { useContext } from "react";
import { AuthContext } from "../context/AuthContext";

function Dashboard() {
  const { user, logout } = useContext(AuthContext);

  return (
    <>
      <h1>Welcome {user?.name}</h1>
      <button onClick={logout}>Logout</button>
    </>
  );
}
